\f0\fs24 \cf0 Hi There! My name is Derek and I am your typical nerd who loves all things Tech and/or tech-related. However I also love my family, our dog Rory, and last but not least the big garden spider by the garbage cans named Fred. I started on the path to IT when I separated from the US Army in 2010 by going to ITT Technical Institute for Information Services Administration (Associate\'92s of Science). 2 days after I graduated there I began my Bachelor\'92s in Information Technology from Colorado State University. My first IT position was working for Cabela\'92s in Columbus, Ohio and I setup/installed all IT components ranging from POS machines to Cash Office workstations as well as the digital signage and interior infrastructure. After that I worked for Northrop Grumman for a while and now I am working for a healthcare IT company-where I am now.\
After being here for 2 years I am seeing that maybe this isn\'92t something I want to do long term so I set out to look for other IT related vocations as I still do love all things tech and of course, bigger, faster, stronger, etc (you get the picture). I stumbled across a group of fine people on operationcode.org and a light bulb appeared above my head and I was filled with awe and amazement for the development world. As I went from window to window looking in on this field I recalled the classes I have taken regarding programming and bashing out lines of code or fixing an issue on Github. As I sat there thinking I came to a single conclusion: I want it, I want to learn and grow my foundation in IT to include the coding/engineering/development side of the IT bouncy house.}
